<h1 id="transitiongoals-followup">#transitiongoals followup</h1>

<p>Some general thoughts: it&rsquo;s been fascinating/fun/interesting to see how my priorities changed as I arrived in California.</p>

<h2 id="personal-growth-things">&ldquo;Personal growth&rdquo; things</h2>

<h3 id="meet-five-5-people-in-a-one-on-one-setting">Meet five (5) people in a one-on-one setting</h3>

<p>Meeting people socially did happen, but not in this fashion. This goal came out of two things: not having substantial friendships after my previous summer internships happened, and a desire to branch out and get to meet new people by confidently inviting them out to places. The first did happen, in a different fashion: I met other interns my age with whom I think I will have lasting friendships. Having an extended co-op (May through December), plus having the ability to go out on long road trips to amazing places in California (like the Marin Headlands and Mammoth Lakes) heavily contributed to this.</p>

<p>However, I still want to start/get a lot better/practice meeting people and having lunch one-on-one. I can think of a couple of candidates in the Bay Area I can start with.</p>

<h3 id="visit-five-5-iconic-places-in-nature">Visit five (5) iconic places in nature</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one I accomplished. The final list of twelve, after eight months:</p>

<ul>
<li>Marin Headlands</li>
<li>Land&rsquo;s End</li>
<li>Castle Rock State Park</li>
<li>Mission Peak</li>
<li>Half Moon Bay</li>
<li>Big Sur</li>
<li>Lake Tahoe (twice - once in summer, once for winter skiing)</li>
<li>Mammoth Lakes</li>
<li>Mojave Desert</li>
<li>Death Valley</li>
<li>Grand Canyon</li>
<li>Zion National Park</li>
</ul>

<p>I still have a lot that I want to tackle, however - being in California has only made my list of places longer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pinnacles National Park</li>
<li>Sequoia National Park</li>
<li>Joshua Tree National Park</li>
<li>Salton Sea</li>
<li>Mt. Shasta</li>
<li>The rest of the Sierras (likely some sort of CA-395 highway drive)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="take-an-amazing-photo-every-week">Take an amazing photo every week</h3>

<p>Looking back on the photos that I&rsquo;ve taken from this co-op, I likely got very close to this, despite only using my iPhone (didn&rsquo;t even bring my dSLR). Especially near the end of this co-op, I was essentially there - my Thanksgiving trip had multiple amazing photos each morning and afternoon. You can see my Instagram for proof. Earlier on, however, I did not have as many amazing/adventurous weekends, which ended up being my primary opportunities for amazing photos.</p>

<p>In conclusion: I got close to this goal through finding amazing settings for photographs. I should take the weeks in which I don&rsquo;t have these opportunities to try to be more artsy. I&rsquo;m also seriously considering buying myself a Fuji X100T, a great small portable camera that I could throw in my backpack and take anywhere.</p>

<h3 id="read-24-books">Read 24 books</h3>

<p>I got nowhere close with this. I read a total of one and a half books. I first started <em>Between the World and Me</em> by Ta-Nehisi Coates in June, which I then ended up restarting and finishing on my flights back home in December. In September, I also read <em>Flight Club</em> by Chuck Palahniuk, which a coworker insisted I borrow from him.</p>

<p>This goal is something that I&rsquo;m beginning to perceive as even more desirable. A lot of people I&rsquo;ve started admiring for their thoughts are clearly well-read, and not just in Internet thinkpieces. I&rsquo;m just not sure how to gain time to achieve it.</p>

<h3 id="document-what-i-created-and-consumed-for-every-day">Document what I created and consumed for every day</h3>

<p>I (with about 80-90% accuracy) have tracked my podcast diet over my time in California. I didn&rsquo;t track the TV or Internet that I consumed as well, largely due to little TV consumption and an incredible amount of Internet consumption. I could/should start TV consumption tracking. I&rsquo;m not sure how to track Internet consumption. I downloaded RescueTime a couple of weeks ago, which feels rather intrusive but could have useful results.</p>

<p>I plan to make a post about my podcast diet and the podcasts that I recommend soon.</p>

<h3 id="become-physically-fit">Become physically fit</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gained 5-10 pounds since I left Michigan. Being in an office and buying a car means I&rsquo;ve been decently sedentary during the week, despite going out and hiking on weekends. Buying an Apple Watch helped me track and understand my sedentary-ness, and I have put time in my schedule during next semester for working out.</p>

<h3 id="physical-activity-every-day">Physical activity every day</h3>

<p>This didn&rsquo;t happen. I went to the gym only a couple of times, although I tried to get out and hike every weekend.</p>

<h3 id="gym-three-times-a-week">Gym three times a week</h3>

<p>I went about three times in eight months.</p>

<h3 id="run-a-5k-without-stopping">Run a 5k without stopping</h3>

<p>I did go for a few runs during August, but never into a good routine (or beyond 2.25 miles). I think if I set a specific 5k as my goal and set a training schedule, I could hold myself to it. This seems like a good goal for after I graduate, and have a consistent life schedule.</p>

<h2 id="do-technical-things">Do technical things</h2>

<h3 id="apply-for-grad-school">Apply for grad school</h3>

<p>I wrote a draft statement of purpose and talked to two professors about recommendation letters, but this ultimately didn&rsquo;t happen. I didn&rsquo;t think I could put forward a competitive application for the high-caliber Ph.D. and master&rsquo;s programs I was looking for. I also received a full-time offer in the Bay Area, that I decided to take.</p>

<h3 id="return-offer">Return offer</h3>

<p>I received a return offer, and accepted it.</p>

<h3 id="volunteer-with-chezy-champs">Volunteer with Chezy Champs</h3>

<p>This goal was intended to be a small step towards a larger goal. Rejoining the FIRST Robotics community seemed like a good, constructive use of my time outside of work. Attending Chezy Champs felt like a good first step to rejoining the community, and finding a good role within it.</p>

<p>However, two things have conspired against this goal.</p>

<p>Firstly, I don&rsquo;t think rejoining the FIRST Robotics community is the best use of my time outside of work. I think I need to focus on fulfilling a lot of the goals that I missed (physical activity and exercise, reading books), exploring California, and trying to do constructive things in new areas and fields.</p>

<p>Secondly, Chezy Champs was the same weekend as I was able to attend the Southern California taping of the Grand Tour as a member of the audience, one of my favorite TV shows for years. <a href="http://www.thedrive.com/a-list/5329/exclusive-inside-the-grand-tour-taping-in-california">This link</a> talks about the taping the day before for the new opening segment - I didn&rsquo;t attend that, but the next day when they taped the in-tent segments.</p>

<h2 id="fun-things">Fun things</h2>

<h3 id="beat-a-pokemon-game">Beat a Pokemon game</h3>

<p>With the previously mentioned old DS Lite and Pokemon Platinum, I beat Spear Pillar sometime in August-ish. So now I just have to defeat the Elite Four. I should have more time at school to finish this.</p>

<h3 id="get-a-ridiculous-selfie-with-a-silicon-valley-icon">Get a ridiculous selfie with a Silicon Valley icon</h3>

<p>This goal was in the vein of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the Bay Area, let&rsquo;s do some silly/stupid Silicon Valley things&rdquo;. I did plenty other things in this vein (chasing Snap Spectacles to Big Sur, feeling like I was in a ridiculously tech-oriented area) that I didn&rsquo;t feel any need for this one specifically.</p>

<h3 id="get-a-ride-around-an-amazing-racetrack">Get a ride around an amazing racetrack</h3>

<p>This one was within grasp for a lot of my co-op, but I didn&rsquo;t think about it seriously much until the end. I bought a bone-stock BMW E30, which would be a great candidate for a track day (as long as it survived and I could drive it home), but I never got it to one. I did network/make friends with people who go to track days at Laguna Seca, Thunderhill, and Sonoma, so this can definitely still happen in the future.</p>

<h3 id="go-to-a-sf-cars-and-coffee-and-or-pebble-beach-concours-d-elegance">Go to a SF Cars and Coffee and/or Pebble Beach Concours d&rsquo;Elegance</h3>

<p>Neither of these happened, for two different reasons. SF Cars and Coffee has been cancelled for most of the last eight months, and I couldn&rsquo;t get away during the week of Pebble Beach for the hour-and-a-half (one way) drive. Almost all of the cheap activites are during the week. However, I&rsquo;ve realized these events are less important; I didn&rsquo;t have trouble meeting people who enjoyed cars. The Bay Area is teeming with them, including the person who I sold my E30 to.</p>

<h3 id="solve-a-rubik-s-cube">Solve a Rubik&rsquo;s Cube</h3>

<p>I completely forgot about this one. It&rsquo;s honestly not that important - something to try when I have free time and I&rsquo;m looking for a puzzle like this.</p>

<h3 id="become-ok-at-skateboarding">Become OK at skateboarding</h3>

<p>This was contingent on buying a helmet, which I never got around to. I did skate around for about half an hour with one not-great fall, in total. It was difficult finding places to skateboard where it&rsquo;s socially acceptable to skateboard and feels like an open/welcoming space to newcomers. Also, it feels impossible to take good falls like it is for skiing or snowboarding.</p>

<h2 id="goals-that-i-m-not-sure-how-to-tackle">Goals that I&rsquo;m not sure how to tackle</h2>

<h3 id="stop-chewing-my-nails">Stop chewing my nails</h3>

<p>This didn&rsquo;t happen, either. I didn&rsquo;t put much thought to it besides further recognizing the need to do so. I think I might try fidget tools and painting my nails next.</p>

<h3 id="have-a-better-sense-of-style-and-wardrobe">Have a better sense of style and wardrobe</h3>

<p>I think I made progress on this front. My work attire started as a button-up with jeans or chinos, and gradually became hoodies with a more colorful set of V-necks and jeans or chinos. I also tried bleaching and then dying my hair, which I thought worked well and I should play around with more. I was definitely more conscientous.</p>

<p>I want to work on removing hoodies largely from my wardrobe - that really sticks out as being lazy, male, and tech. I also want to explore/mess around more with my hair.</p>

<h3 id="start-cooking">Start cooking</h3>

<p>This didn&rsquo;t happen - there was cheap food for lunch and dinner that was far too accessible. I&rsquo;m not sure if this&rsquo;ll happen when I&rsquo;m full-time either: I have too many things I want to do with my time, and far too many cool and interesting places to eat in the Bay Area in my free time. I should really prioritize this&hellip; ugh.</p>

<h3 id="help-ship-an-ios-app">Help ship an iOS app</h3>

<p>I ended up not working on non-work projects during my co-op. I would still like to do this, but I feel similarly to my involvement in FIRST Robotics and Chezy Champs: it&rsquo;s simply not as interesting to me anymore, and I&rsquo;d rather try other things.</p>

<h3 id="own-a-console-play-more-video-games">Own a console/play more video games</h3>

<p>I bought an Xbox One in September that I sold right before I finished my co-op. I rarely played it, despite having my two favorite games (Forza Motorsports 6 and Forza Horizon 2). I did end up playing some PC games (namely Team Fortress 2 - which essentially is like comfort food to me - and some Counter Strike: Global Offensive). I could see myself maybe playing more PC games (and building a desktop) to have a social thing to do with friends farther away. Console games have less appeal to me, other then for exclusives.</p>

<h3 id="write-more">Write more</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made some progress on this front. In October, I spent $50 on the macOS and iOS apps for <a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> to serve as an impetus to start journaling. I&rsquo;m successfully journaling every couple of days (usually every day, occassionally twice a week). That&rsquo;s served as good writing practice</p>
